Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn; 

1. Everything's better with a pretty diagram
Add a schema to your blog post illustrating the flow of the request created when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter.

The diagram should show:

DNS resolution
that the request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
that the traffic is encrypted
that the traffic goes through a firewall
that the request is distributed via a load balancer
that the web server answers the request by serving a web page
that the application server generates the web page
that the application server request data from the database
Gliffy is free and what I personally use, but feel free to use what fits you best.
